# Livogen Iron Deficiency Campaign API

## Project Overview
This project is part of a campaign where doctors can enter their personal information to receive personalized banners and videos branded with Livogen. The backend API is built using Node.js and ffmpeg to dynamically generate these custom assets based on the input provided.

This project marks my first foray into Node.js development, focusing on server-side media generation.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **ffmpeg**: Make sure ffmpeg is installed and available in your system's PATH.
